# Scripts Folder

This folder contains only `.bat` launcher files.

## Rules
- Do NOT create `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, or `.ts` files here.
- All automation must use MCP tools via Gemini CLI.
- If you see any script files here, delete them; they were created by mistake.

## MCP Config
This folder includes `scripts/.gemini/settings.json` so MCP tools are available even if Gemini starts with the `scripts/` directory as the workspace root.
It also includes `scripts/GEMINI.md` as a fallback instruction set for that workspace root.
