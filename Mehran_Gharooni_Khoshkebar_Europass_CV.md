### Enhancing LSTM Predictions: A Novel Approach to Stock Market Efficiency Evaluation with Retrainable LSTM Model

Gharooni Khoshkebar, Mehran and Idris, Norisma and Madjlesi Taklimi, Zahra (2023). SSRN (Social Science Research Network) Journal Publication: Enhancing LSTM Predictions: A Novel Approach to Stock Market Efficiency Evaluation with Retrainable LSTM Model. SSRN Electronic Journal.  
https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4782069

This research develops an adaptive approach for stock market forecasting where an LSTM model is automatically retrained based on qualitative directional accuracy, a strategy that significantly enhances model performance and adapts to market volatility.

## Work experience

### Lead AI Engineer | Unique Tech Solution LTD (UTS) | 01/11/2024 - 01/10/2025 | Nottingham, United Kingdom

Drove the hands-on, end-to-end development of the patented "SmartTeach" AI platform, personally architecting and implementing the full system stack: Python backend (FastAPI), PostgreSQL database, and a responsive frontend (React, Node.js).

Integrated Google's Gemini 2.5 models via Vertex AI to automate the evaluation of multi-modal student submissions, a core feature of the platform's intellectual property.

Successfully delivered and deployed the production system (app.mysmartteach.com), which is now undergoing pilot testing for widespread adoption by the Nottingham City Council.

### Local LLM Deployment Specialist | Unique Tech Solution LTD (UTS) | 01/06/2025 - 01/10/2025 | Nottingham, United Kingdom

**Client Project:** University of Nottingham Malaysia

Led a strategic project for the University of Nottingham Malaysia to deploy and manage powerful, local instances of Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen3 235B, Gpt oss:120B) on their on-premise HPC infrastructure.

As the lead engineer for UTS, I architected the full user-facing system, developing an intuitive frontend for model interaction and integrating it with the SQL backend for secure, permission-based access. The core engineering challenge was to develop a robust backend API for session management while creating a dynamic frontend that enforced tiered permissions, giving administrators granular control over user access and HPC resources.

Delivered a bespoke solution that provided over 100 university researchers with safe, high-performance access to AI tools, ensuring data privacy for sensitive academic research.

### Automate Cloud Systems Engineer | University of Malaya | 01/11/2024 - 01/03/2025 | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
